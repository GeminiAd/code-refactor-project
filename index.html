        Changed <div class="hero"> to <figure class="hero"> as figure is more representative of what the hero banner is.
        Also of note is that the original index.html just had <div class="hero"></div>, and the image was loaded in css using background-image and background-size.
        Well, if you load the hero image that way, you cannot put alt attributes for accessibility. Therefore, I changed this code by loading the image using an
        image element, and I had to style the image differently in the CSS file to make sure everything displayed the same.

        <!-- 
            Changed the <div> that was here to a figure, as each of these <div> was a bundle of image and text, which is what a <figure> represents.
            Also, each figure here used to have different classes - <figure id="search-engine-optimization"> had the class specified as "search-engine-optimization",
            and <figure id="online-reputation-management"> had the class "online-reputation-management", for example. I set the class for each of these elements
            to "solution", as each of these elements share many sizing and layout attributes.
            I labeled the class as 'solution', as each of these figures is a business solution that Horiseon is providing to customers.

                This image used to have the class "float-left", which made this element float-left. I felt like that was passing
                some styling off to the html, so I removed that class and placed these float calls inside the css formatting for each 
                of the following images.

                    The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                <p>
                    The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

                <p>
                    Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.

            Each of these sections used to be a <div>. I switched it to a <section> as a section is supposed to start with a header, which is how
            these divs were set up. Also, each of these sections used to have their own class - the first section had a class of "benefit-lead", the
            second section was class "benefit-brand", and the third was "benefit-cost". I switched all of these to class "benefit" as they share
            identical styling attributes.

            <!-- 
                These headers used to be <h3>. According to good practice, each webpage should have 1 <h1> header, the next headers should be
                <h2> headers, and <h3> headers should only be used if its a subheading. Since these <h3> headers weren't a subheader of any
                <h2> header, for each benefit section I switched the <h3> header to an <h2> header and reduced the size of the text in the css file.
